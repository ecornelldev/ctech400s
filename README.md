# Development Repo

## Purpose

This repo will be used to collaborate and store files for the development materials relating to student exercises in this this series.

## Getting Started

To begin your process with developing materials, start with the following:

* Familiarize yourself with the "Wiki" area in this repository. This area contains guidance on processes and tips for writing your specs.
* Take a look at the "Projects" area in this repository. This area will contain the upcoming tasks that need to be done for the development of exercises, and they should be ordered by priority level. Use this area to track your progress.
* Take a look through the folder structure in the code section and open the README files and the specs.md files to familiarize yourself with what you'll be writing in.
* If you have any questions that aren't addressed in the wiki, submit an issue in the repository for us to respond to. We will add responses into the wiki as needed to build a stronger knowledge base.
* Always keep in mind, if you aren't sure what you should put in a field in one of the specs.md files, you probably don't need to put anything there yet. These templates are designed to be flexible to a wide variety of programs and exercise types, so there will likely be a lot of fields that don't apply to you, like a tax form ;)

We are very active in developing and refining this process, so feedback is always welcome and appreciated.
