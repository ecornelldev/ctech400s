## Exercise Context
It's time to experiment with string methods .upper(), .lower(), .find(), and .replace()

The code editor contains the string <code>phrase = 'Don\'t worry, be happy!' </code>

Experiment with the string methods you have just learned on this string.

For example, <code>phrase.replace('w', 'm')</code> returns 'Don't morry be happy'

Feel free to create your own strings and experiment with them.
