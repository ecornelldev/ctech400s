Examine the code in the code editor.
It contains string <code>fairy_tale</code> which is composed of an exerpt from the popular children's story Goldilocks and the Three Bears. <br>
However, this story contains a number of spelling errors and typos. Note these errors below: </b>

<pre>
Next Goldilocks went upstairs, <b>wear</b> she found <b>tre</b> beds. There was a great big <b>bord</b>, 
a middle-sized bed and a tiny little <b>bard</b>. By now she was feeling rather tired. so she climbed into the big 
<b>bord</b> and lay down. The big bed was very hard and far too <b>biig</b>. 
Then she tried the middle-sized <b>bord</b>, but that was far too soft. so she climbed into the tiny little 
bed. It was neither <b>two</b> hard nor too soft. In fact, it felt just <b>write</b>, all <b>crazy</b> and warm
and in no <b>tine</b> at all Goldilocks fell fast asleep.
</pre>

The code editor also contains two lists:

1. <code>spelling_errors</code>, which contains the spelling errors
2. <code>corrections</code> which contains the correct spelling

You'll notice that the list indices of the errors correspond to the indicies of the correct spelling. For example, element one in <code>spelling_errors</code> is 'wear', while element one in <code>corrections</code> is the corrected form 'where'

Using what we have learned in this module, correct the spelling errors in the story using the two lists provided.
At the end of your program print <code>fairy_tale</code> to the screen.
