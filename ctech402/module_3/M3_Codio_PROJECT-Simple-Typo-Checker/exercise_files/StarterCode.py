fairy_tale = 'Next Goldilocks went upstairs, where she found three beds. There was a great big bed, a middle-sized bed and a 
tiny little bed. By now she was feeling rather tired. so she climbed into the big bed and lay down. The big bed was very hard and far too big. 
Then she tried the middle-sized bed, but that was far too soft. so she climbed into the tiny little bed. 
It was neither too hard nor too soft. In fact, it felt just right, all cosy and warm. and in no tine at all Goldilocks fell fast asleep.'
