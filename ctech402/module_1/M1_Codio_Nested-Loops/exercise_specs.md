# Exercise Title: Working with Nested Loops
---
## Key Technical Outcome
Given an outer loop, students must write the inner loop to complete the program, making it run successfully. This gives them practice interpreting and writing a nested loop.

## Exercise Context
Write a program that describes differently sized pets. 
Examine the code in <code>exercise.py</code> in the code editor.
It contains two lists, <code>sizes</code> and <code>pets</code>.  
One for loop has already been written for you. 

## Exercise Instructions
Supply the missing code in order to complete the program and successfully run it.

  1. Write a nested for loop that loops through the <code>pets</code> list.
  2. Fill in the portion of the print statement that accesses an element in the <code>pets</code> list.

Correct Output:<br>
<pre>I have a small rabbit
I have a small cat
I have a small dog
I have a medium rabbit
I have a medium cat
I have a medium dog
I have a large rabbit
I have a large cat
I have a large dog</pre>
