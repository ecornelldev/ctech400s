# Exercise Title: Module 1 Project: Write Nested for Loops
---
## Key Technical Outcome
Write a Program that has a Nested “for” Loop inside of another loop

## Exercise Context
Examine the code in <code>exercise.py</code> in the code editor. It contains two lists, <code>entree</code> and <code>side</code>.

Write a program that generates dinner suggestions based on these two lists. Use nested for loops to print out meal suggestions containing one dish and side from each list. 

## Exercise Instructions
  1. Add <b>one new element</b> either the <code>entree</code> or <code>side</code> lists. You should have a total of 7 options between both lists.
  2. In <code>exercise.py</code>, starting on line 4, write your outer loop that selects an entree from the corresponding list.
  3. On line 5, write your inner loop that selects a side from the corresponding list.
  4. On line 6, write a print statement that prints all (12) entree and side combination options as recommendations. Make sure the printed statement is formatted with spaces and can be easily read.
