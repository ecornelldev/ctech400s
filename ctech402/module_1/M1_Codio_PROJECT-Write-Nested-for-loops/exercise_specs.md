# Exercise Title: Module 1 Project: Write Nested for Loops
---
## Key Technical Outcome
Write a Program that has a Nested “for” Loop 

## Exercise Context

## Exercise Instructions

**This exercise is basically identical to one the students have already done and to an example given in the videos. I think we need one that does something else with the lists rather than just another print statement. -JG**

**I'm having a hard time coming up with something that doesn't involve printing. Anything else I come up with requires more knowledge of lists, ranges etc., which we haven't covered yet. For example, i thought about swapping items in a list, or implementing .sort()...can't come up with something more elementary.-GI*

# UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS

Write a program that generates the multiplication table of 1-10 (see chart below). 

<pre>
1X1=2         2X1 = 2   3X1=3     . . .   10X1=10
1X2=2         .         .                 .
1X3=3         .         .                 .
1X4=4         .         .                 .
1X5=5         .         .                 .
1X6-6         .         .                 .
1X7=7         .         .                 .
1X8=8         .         .                 .
1X9=9         .         .                 .
1X10=10      2X10 = 20  3X10=30  . . .   10X10=100     
</pre>

Use a nested for loop to print out the table.

Hint: Each loop should iterate 10 times (from 1 - 10)
  

Sample output:

<pre>
1 times 1 is 1
1 times 2 is 2
.
.
.
4 times 1 is 4
4 times 2 is 8
.
.
.
10 times 9 is 90
10 times 10 is 100
</pre>



Write a program that generates dinner suggestions based on these two lists.<br>
Use a nested for loop to print each entree and side combination as recommendations. 

Hint:
  1. One loop should loops through the entre list.
  2. One loop should loop through the side list.

<b>Sample Output:</b>
<pre>You should try pasta alfredo and french fries
You should try pasta alfredo and mashed potatoes
You should try pasta alfredo and salad
You should try baked salmon and french fries
You should try baked salmon and mashed potatoes
You should try baked salmon and salad
You should try chicken parmesan and french fries
You should try chicken parmesan and mashed potatoes
You should try chicken parmesan and salad
You should try sliders and french fries
You should try sliders and mashed potatoes
You should try sliders and salad</pre>
