# Exercise Title: Module 1 Project: Write Nested for Loops
---
## Key Technical Outcome
Write a Program that has a Nested “for” Loop 

## Exercise Context

## Exercise Instructions

**This exercise is basically identical to one the students have already done and to an example given in the videos. I think we need one that does something else with the lists rather than just another print statement. -JG**

Examine the code in <code>exercise.py</code> in the code editor. It contains two lists, <code>entree</code> and <code>side</code>.

Write a program that generates dinner suggestions based on these two lists.<br>
Use a nested for loop to print each entree and side combination as recommendations. 

Hint:
  1. One loop should loops through the entree list
  2. One loop should loop through the side list.
