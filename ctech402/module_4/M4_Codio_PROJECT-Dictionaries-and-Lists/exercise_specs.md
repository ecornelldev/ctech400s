# Exercise Title: Dictionaries and Lists
---
# Instructional Requirements
## Key Technical Outcome

## Exercise Context
(not student facing, context for us: Schedule example, dictionary has list of office #s, everyone who is on 2nd floor is moving to 3rd floor, the program has to find all names for which the value starts with (2) and change that keyâ€™s value to (3) instead. Requires extracting list and testing each key if it meets given condition and correcting with new value)

## Exercise Instructions
<b>[I came up with two possibilities for this. See solution code for a better idea of how students will approach these]</b>
<b> We can also use strings for office numbers instead of ints </b><br>

<b>Option One:</b>

Examine the code in the code editor. It contains a dictionary <code>office_numbers</code> of employees and their office numbers.<br>
Everyone who currently has an office on the second floor will be moving to a new office on the third floor. </br>
Currently, every office number begins with the floor number followed by two numbers (e.g. 204). <br>
To make it easier for employees to remember their new office numbers, the office numbers will remain the same with the exception of the first number (floor number). For example, Frank's office will change from 204 to 304 once he moves to the third floor. 

Putting into practive everything you have learned about dictionaries,  find all office numbers on the second floor and update their values to the new office numbers on the third floor.
Print the updated office list at the end of your program.

<b>Option Two:</b>

Examine the code in the code editor. It contains two dictionaries: <code>office_numbers</code> and <code>office_updates</code>.
<code>office_numbers</code> is a dictionary containg information about employees and their office numbers.<br>
Everyone who currently has an office on the second floor will be moving to a new office on the third floor. </br>
Currently, every office number begins with the floor number followed by two numbers (e.g. 204). <br>
<code>office_updates</code> contains the office numbers on the second floor and their corresponding offices on the third floor. Print the updated office list at the end of your program.

Putting into practive everything you have learned about dictionaries, find all office numbers on the second floor and update their values to the new office numbers on the third floor.
