# Instructional Requirements
## Key Technical Outcome
len(), in, not in, update, clear, keys(), values(), pop()


## Exercise Context

Examine the code in the code editor. It contains your weekly planner from [page name] (with the additon of a few entries). <br>

You are just too busy and would like to have Monday and Wednesday off as rest days. <br> 

## Exercise Instructions
Using what you have learned about dictionary functions, check to see if Monday and/or Friday is in your planner, and if so, remove them from your itinerary. <br>
Print your planner at the end of your program to check your updated itinerary. <br>


**This can be done even more compactly: 
del weekly_planner['Monday']
del weekly_planner['Friday']
So this might need to be a little more complex a question.**
