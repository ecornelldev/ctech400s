---
## Key Technical Outcome
Loops and list functions

## Exercise Context

## Exercise Instructions

**This is problematic, because students won't realize they need to use a second list. Trying to `remove()` elements from the main list will fail and students don't have the information they need to understand why it's failing.  Better to ask students just to make a list of only the prime numbers from the list they are given? For added difficulty, we could ask them to print that list in ascending numerical order. -JG**

#Option 1:
A prime number is a whole number which is only divisble than 1 and itself.
<code>exercise.py</code> contains a list of integer values.
Write a program that removes any value from the list that is NOT a prime number.

#Option # 2:
Write program to remove odd elements instead:

<code>exercise.py</code> contains a list of integer values.
Write a program that removes all odd numbers from the list using list methods.
Print the list to the screen.
