# Exercise Title: Practicing List Functions
---
## Key Technical Outcome
Apply and practice reversed(), sorted(), max(), min(), sum()


## Exercise Context
In this exercise you will have a chance to use the `reversed()`, `sorted()`, `max()`, `min()`, and `sum()` functions.

The code editor contains three lists: one containing only integers, one containg only strings, and one containing values of different data types.

Experiment applying the five functions to these lists. Note that as you try applying these functions to the different lists, not all of them will work. The success of the functions depends on the data types within a list. Consider which ones worked, and which ones didn't? Why?

Try combining some of these functions, such as `sorted()` and `reversed()`. Remember to use `print()` to see the results.

## Exercise Instructions
If you're not sure where to start, try adding these to <code>exercise.py</code> and running the program to see the results:
1. `print(sum(int_list))`
2. `print(sorted(int_list))`
3. `print(sorted(str_list))`
