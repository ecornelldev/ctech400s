# Exercise Title: Useful List Methods
---
## Key Technical Outcome
Give a list of unsorted numbers and ask students to remove the largest number from the list.

Two ways to accomplish this:
1. Use max() to get the largest value and remove() to remove that value 
2. Use sort() to sort the list and pop() to remove last element()

## Exercise Context
Examine the code in <code>exercise.py</code> in the code editor. It contains a list of unsorted integers <code>int_list</code>.

int_list = [97, 85, 45, 67, 2, 101, 9, 36, 4]

## Exercise Instructions
Using some of the list methods and functions you have seen, find a way to remove the largest integer from the list.

Note: At the end of your program, <code>int_list</code> should have the value of [97, 85, 45, 67, 2, 9, 36, 4].
