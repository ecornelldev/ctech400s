## Exercise Context
It's time to write your first function...

## Exercise Instructions

Part 1:

The absolute value of a number is how far a number is from zero. <br>
5 is 5 away from 0 so the absolute value of 5 is 5. <br>
-5 is also 5 away from 0 so the absolute value of -5 is 5.<br>
Essentially, the absolute value of a negative number is the same number without the negative sign. <br>
An absolute value can only be a 0 or positive number.

Write a function that finds the absolute value of a number. <br>
The function has one argument. The argument must be an integer or floating point value. Therefore, you must supply the function with a positive integer or floating point number when calling it. <br> 
The body of the function will compute the absolute value of that argument and then return the absolute value.

Print the absolute value that was returned from the function.<br>
You can do so by using the following syntax:  <br>
<code>print(function_name(numerical_argument)) </code> <br>
By enclosing the function call inside a print() function, the value returned by the absolute value function will be printed.

Try calling your function multiple times with the following values to test whether your function is working properly:
 
a. -5 # absolute value = 5 <br> 
b. -12.7 # absolute value = 12.7 <br>
c. 46 # absolute value = 46 <br>
d. 5*2-17 # absolute value = 7 <br>


Part 2:

 Write a function that multiples two numbers. <br>
 The function has two arguments. Both arguments must be an integer or floating point number. <br>
 The body of the function will multiply both arguments and return the result. <br>
 Call your functions with any two numerical values of your choosing to test out your function. <br>
 Use the same method as demonstrated above to print the returned value of your function.
