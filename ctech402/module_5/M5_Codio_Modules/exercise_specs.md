## Exercise Context

## Exercise Instructions
Examine the code in the code editor. It is using the stats module to find the mean, medium, range and total sum of a list of numbers.
You'll notice that stats.py does not contain a sum function.

Implement a sum function within stats.py so that exercise.py can run. <re-word>
(Don't make changes to exercise.py)
