## Exercise Context

## Exercise Instructions
Examine the code in <code>exercise.py</code>. It is using the <code>stats</code> module to find the mean, median, range and  total sum of a list of numbers.
However, while <code>stats.py</code> contains functions to find the mean, median and range, it does not contain a function to find the total sum.

Implement the <code>sum</code> function within <code>stats.py</code> so that exercise.py can successfully run.
(Note: Do not make changes to exercise.py)

## Environment/s Used
Terminal. Python interpreter. Code editor.
** Pre-load starter code AND stats.py
