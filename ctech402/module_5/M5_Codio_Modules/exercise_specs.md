## Exercise Context

## Exercise Instructions
Examine the code in <code>exercise.py</code>. It is using the <code>stats</code> module to find the mean, median, range and  total sum of a list of numbers.
However, while <code>stats.py</code> contains functions to find the mean, median and range, it does not contain a function to find the total sum.

Implement the <code>sum</code> function within <code>stats.py</code> so that <code>exercise.py</code> can successfully run.
(Note: Do not make changes to exercise.py)

**sum is not a good example. The students already know about sum() so the question is trivial. They also can get themselves into name conflicts quickly if they aren't careful because stats.sum and sum are easy to mix up. I would rather have them define and use some other function**

## Environment/s Used
Terminal. Python interpreter. Code editor.
** Pre-load starter code AND stats.py
** starter code is exercise.py and stats.py
