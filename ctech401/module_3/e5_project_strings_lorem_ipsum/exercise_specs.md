# Exercise Title:
---
# Instructional Requirements
## Key Technical Outcome
Understand everything covered in module. String operators, String functions and type conversion

## Exercise Context
It's time to put into practice everything we have learned so far about string operators and functions!

## Exercise Instructions

In the code editor, write a program that accomplishes the following three tasks using the appropriate string operators and functions
.
# Part #1
Write a program that repeats a word a given number of times.<br>
Ask a user for two inputs and save each to a variable: (1) a word  (2) the number of times to repeat it. <br>
Using the appropriate string operators, create this new string, and print it to the screen. <br>

For example: <br>
Repeating 'cat' three times results in the new word 'catcatcat'  (<b>necessary to give an example?</b>)

# Part #2
Write a program that uses variables and string operators to create a new string.
Use the given variables and appropriate string operators to create an expression that represents the US State 'Mississippi.' Save this expression to a variable and output this variable to the screen.

a='m'
b='i'
c='s'
d='p'

For example, the word 'sips' can be written using the following experession: c+b+d+c

# Part #3
It's time to play around with string operaters and create your own words! (lame?) (...ideas?)..(Anagram time! lol)
Using the letters 'l' 'e' 't' and 's', see how many 3, 4, and 5 letter word combinations you can come up with. 
Create expressions that represent your words using the given variables and string operators of your choosing, and output these expressions to the screen.

a='l' 
b='e' 
c='t'
d='s'

For example, the word 'sell' can be written using the following expression: d+b+(2*a)

## Any Unique Requirements or Notes?

# Technical Requirements
<em><strong>If these aren't distinct from what is specified in the course and module-level specs, you can leave these blank.</strong></em>

## Environment/s Used
Code editor, terminal

## Language/s Used
<em>Indicate any languages used that are unique to this exercise (this is quite rare).</em>

## Package/s Required
<em>Indicate here any unique packages that need to be installed for the exercise to function.</em>

---
# Test Requirements
<em>Manually graded - perhaps auto assess for syntax errors as well? Can we do this for this and all other manually graded projects?</em>

## Outcome Tests
<em>Indicate here criteria that should be tested relating to the outcomes or outputs of a student's actions in the exercise.</em>

## Student Code Tests
<em>This relates to specific aspects of the student's code which need to be assessed. The best way to indicate these requirements is with comments in your solution code file, indicating the parts of the code which need to be verified. This helps make the requirements less abstract. However, if you have any requirements that are better explained long form, please do so below.</em>

## Process Tests
<em>Indicate here criteria that should be tested relating to the process by which the student reached their outcomes in the exercise.</em>

#  Implementation Decisions

## Graded or Ungraded:
<em>This is easily adjusted in future iterations, but this is a place to indicate whether this exercise will pass a grade to the Canvas gradebook, just provide smart feedback to the student without a grade, or simply serve as a sandbox environment with no evaluation.</em>

## Exercise Type:
<em>This will always be determined in collaboration with the developers, designers, and authors based on the requirements above, what is most feasible and meets the key objectives.</em>

## Success Message
<em>This is the message the student will see when they complete the exercise, in the case that this is an exercise which provides automatic feedback. This should be written after the implementation decisions are made.</em>

## Test Case Failure Messages
<em>These should be written later in development, and only apply to automatically tested programming exercises. These will be written in accordance with the test cases developed for the exercise, which will also need to be specified here.</em>

## Environment Layout:
<em>This is how the environment components will be presented to students. This will usuall relate to Codio panes and what they contain.</em>

## Custom Codio Menu Items:
<em>This is a space to indicate any buttons that will need to be present in the Codio menu beyond the default items in the template.</em>

## New Integrations Required:
<em>We will indicate here if this exercise requires any new and unestablished integrations with Codio or Canvas.</em>
