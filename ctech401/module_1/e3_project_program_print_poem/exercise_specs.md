# Instructional Requirements
## Key Technical Outcome
This exercise will teach students how to create a program with multiple statements. They will learn how programs execute statements in sequential order.

## Exercise Context
For this project, you are going to write a program that prints a poem.
(*<b>should we add somthing telling students that their program will be executed from the top down....slightly more complex program than the one liners they've been writing?</b>)
 
## Exercise Instructions

><em>There was an Old Man with a beard by Edward Lear</em>                          
>'There was an Old Man with a beard, Who said, It is just as I feared! Two Owls and a Hen, Four Larks and a Wren,
> Have all built their nests in my beard!'
 
 A limerick is a humerous poem consisting of 5 lines with the first, second and fifth lines consisting of 
 seven to ten syllables while the  third and fourth lines consists of five to seven syllables. (<b>note: syllable portion may be overkill</b>)<br>
 
 In the code editor, write a program that prints the limerick above to the screen in five separate lines (Hint: use the print function more than once).<br>
 Execute your program on the command line.

Code editor and terminal

# Test Requirements
Can we assess for syntax errors and also do file compare (Make sure there are 5 print statements in their code file, one per line. We may not necessarily have to ensure that particular text is contained in each line)?

## Outcome Tests
<em>Indicate here criteria that should be tested relating to the outcomes or outputs of a student's actions in the exercise.</em>

## Student Code Tests
<em>This relates to specific aspects of the student's code which need to be assessed. The best way to indicate these requirements is with comments in your solution code file, indicating the parts of the code which need to be verified. This helps make the requirements less abstract. However, if you have any requirements that are better explained long form, please do so below.</em>

## Process Tests
<em>Indicate here criteria that should be tested relating to the process by which the student reached their outcomes in the exercise.</em>

#  Implementation Decisions

## Graded or Ungraded:
<em>This is easily adjusted in future iterations, but this is a place to indicate whether this exercise will pass a grade to the Canvas gradebook, just provide smart feedback to the student without a grade, or simply serve as a sandbox environment with no evaluation.</em>

## Exercise Type:
<em>This will always be determined in collaboration with the developers, designers, and authors based on the requirements above, what is most feasible and meets the key objectives.</em>

## Success Message
<em>This is the message the student will see when they complete the exercise, in the case that this is an exercise which provides automatic feedback. This should be written after the implementation decisions are made.</em>

## Test Case Failure Messages
<em>These should be written later in development, and only apply to automatically tested programming exercises. These will be written in accordance with the test cases developed for the exercise, which will also need to be specified here.</em>

## Environment Layout:
<em>This is how the environment components will be presented to students. This will usuall relate to Codio panes and what they contain.</em>

## Custom Codio Menu Items:
<em>This is a space to indicate any buttons that will need to be present in the Codio menu beyond the default items in the template.</em>

## New Integrations Required:
<em>We will indicate here if this exercise requires any new and unestablished integrations with Codio or Canvas.</em>
