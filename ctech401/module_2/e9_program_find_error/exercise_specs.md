## Key Technical Outcome
Recognize three different types of errors that they may encounter

Syntax errors<br>
Type Errors<br>
Name error (variable or function python doesn't recognize)<br>

## Exercise Context
There are three kinds of errors you may encounter: syntax errors, name errors, and type errors.<br>
It's good practice to learn to identify errors in your code and fix them.<br>
The program below (?) contains some of the errors we discussed. 

## Exercise Instructions

Run the program [name of program] and notice the errors.<br>
Find the errors and fix them. <br>
Each time you fix an error, run your code again and notice the output.<br>
Continue this process until all of the errors are gone!

<em>source code with errors:</em> <br>
x=5+&9<br>
y=x+'4'<br>
z=x+y<br>
pint(z)
  
  

## Any Unique Requirements or Notes?

---
# Technical Requirements
<em><strong></strong></em>

## Environment/s Used
<em>Terminal, code editor</em>

## Language/s Used
<em>Indicate any languages used that are unique to this exercise (this is quite rare).</em>

## Package/s Required
<em>Indicate here any unique packages that need to be installed for the exercise to function.</em>

---
# Test Requirements
<em>File compare and test output</em>

## Outcome Tests
<em>Indicate here criteria that should be tested relating to the outcomes or outputs of a student's actions in the exercise.</em>

## Student Code Tests
<em>This relates to specific aspects of the student's code which need to be assessed. The best way to indicate these requirements is with comments in your solution code file, indicating the parts of the code which need to be verified. This helps make the requirements less abstract. However, if you have any requirements that are better explained long form, please do so below.</em>

## Process Tests
<em>Indicate here criteria that should be tested relating to the process by which the student reached their outcomes in the exercise.</em>

#  Implementation Decisions

## Graded or Ungraded:
<em>This is easily adjusted in future iterations, but this is a place to indicate whether this exercise will pass a grade to the Canvas gradebook, just provide smart feedback to the student without a grade, or simply serve as a sandbox environment with no evaluation.</em>

## Exercise Type:
<em>This will always be determined in collaboration with the developers, designers, and authors based on the requirements above, what is most feasible and meets the key objectives.</em>

## Success Message
<em>This is the message the student will see when they complete the exercise, in the case that this is an exercise which provides automatic feedback. This should be written after the implementation decisions are made.</em>

## Test Case Failure Messages
<em>These should be written later in development, and only apply to automatically tested programming exercises. These will be written in accordance with the test cases developed for the exercise, which will also need to be specified here.</em>

## Environment Layout:
<em>This is how the environment components will be presented to students. This will usuall relate to Codio panes and what they contain.</em>

## Custom Codio Menu Items:
<em>This is a space to indicate any buttons that will need to be present in the Codio menu beyond the default items in the template.</em>

## New Integrations Required:
<em>We will indicate here if this exercise requires any new and unestablished integrations with Codio or Canvas.</em>
