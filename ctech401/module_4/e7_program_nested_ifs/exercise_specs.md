## Key Technical Outcome
Ability to write nested ifs and elifs

## Exercise Context
It's time to try your hand at writing a nested if/else statement.

## Exercise Instructions

In the code editor, write a program that assigns a letter grade to a student's numerical score.

Ask the user to input their score (an integer value between 0 and 100) on the command line.

Use the following rules to determine the equivalent letter grade and output the letter grade to the user:

A = 90-100<br>
B = 80-89<br>
C = 70-79<br>
D = 60-69<br>
F =< 60<br>

<em>Sample output:</em><br>
You received an A!

If the student scored 100%, output the additional message 'Perfect Score!'


## Any Unique Requirements or Notes?

---
# Technical Requirements


## Environment/s Used
Code editor and terminal

## Language/s Used
<em>Indicate any languages used that are unique to this exercise (this is quite rare).</em>

## Package/s Required
<em>Indicate here any unique packages that need to be installed for the exercise to function.</em>

---
# Test Requirements
<em>I'm leaning toward just testing for syntax errors so we can allow some variability in the implementation.<br>
Maybe add a quiz to accompany this exercise testing students comprehension of preferred style. For example:<br>
 Which is the best method- show elif as an option

</em>

## Outcome Tests
<em>Indicate here criteria that should be tested relating to the outcomes or outputs of a student's actions in the exercise.</em>

## Student Code Tests
<em>This relates to specific aspects of the student's code which need to be assessed. The best way to indicate these requirements is with comments in your solution code file, indicating the parts of the code which need to be verified. This helps make the requirements less abstract. However, if you have any requirements that are better explained long form, please do so below.</em>

## Process Tests
<em>Indicate here criteria that should be tested relating to the process by which the student reached their outcomes in the exercise.</em>

#  Implementation Decisions

## Graded or Ungraded:
<em>This is easily adjusted in future iterations, but this is a place to indicate whether this exercise will pass a grade to the Canvas gradebook, just provide smart feedback to the student without a grade, or simply serve as a sandbox environment with no evaluation.</em>

## Exercise Type:
<em>This will always be determined in collaboration with the developers, designers, and authors based on the requirements above, what is most feasible and meets the key objectives.</em>

## Success Message
<em>This is the message the student will see when they complete the exercise, in the case that this is an exercise which provides automatic feedback. This should be written after the implementation decisions are made.</em>

## Test Case Failure Messages
<em>These should be written later in development, and only apply to automatically tested programming exercises. These will be written in accordance with the test cases developed for the exercise, which will also need to be specified here.</em>

## Environment Layout:
<em>This is how the environment components will be presented to students. This will usuall relate to Codio panes and what they contain.</em>

## Custom Codio Menu Items:
<em>This is a space to indicate any buttons that will need to be present in the Codio menu beyond the default items in the template.</em>

## New Integrations Required:
<em>We will indicate here if this exercise requires any new and unestablished integrations with Codio or Canvas.</em>
